# religious-studies-notes
A repository of notes on religious studies organised by theme, searchable, linked, comprehensive.

Basic principles as follow:
- Main container will include search options in navbar on left of article
- Main article will contain all content in separate divs
- Each entry will have classes that act as tags for the purpose of filtering the displayed content.
- By default only a summary of each entry will be shown, but you can click to expand and read the full entry
- Any terms of interest in the entry will be linked to the main entry on that subject - clicking will display a custom div that is fixed in position (so will always open in the same place on screen) - this will contain a brief summary / description with the option to click and go to the full entry
- Major connected items will have dedicated buttons to highlight their importance
